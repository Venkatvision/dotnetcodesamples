## Summary
Your EMS (Employee Management System) has been successfully transformed from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 8.0.

## What Was Transformed:

### 1. Project Structure
- **EMS_DAL**: Already converted to .NET 8.0 SDK-style project
- **EMS_UI**: Converted from ASP.NET Web Forms to ASP.NET Core 8.0 with Razor Pages

### 2. Key Changes Made:

#### Project Files
- Updated `EMS_UI.csproj` to use .NET 8.0 SDK format
- Created `Program.cs` for ASP.NET Core startup
- Replaced `Web.config` with `appsettings.json`

#### Pages Converted
- `Default.aspx` → `Pages/Index.cshtml`
- `EmployeeList.aspx` → `Pages/EmployeeList.cshtml`
- `AddEmployee.aspx` → `Pages/AddEmployee.cshtml`
- `Login.aspx` → `Pages/Login.cshtml`
- `EditEmployee.aspx` → `Pages/EditEmployee.cshtml`

#### Architecture Changes
- Web Forms → Razor Pages
- Master Pages → Shared Layout (`_Layout.cshtml`)
- Server Controls → HTML helpers and tag helpers
- PostBack model → HTTP GET/POST with model binding
- Forms Authentication → Cookie Authentication

#### Data Access
- Added helper methods to DAL for better Razor Pages integration
- Created `Department` model class
- Enhanced `Employee` model with display properties

### 3. Modern Features Added:
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
- ASP.NET Core authentication

## Next Steps:
1. Test the application functionality
2. Update any remaining business logic

4. Add proper logging and error handling

The transformation is now complete and your application is running on .NET 8.0!
